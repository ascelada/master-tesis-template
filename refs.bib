abstract = {Abstract A boundary element method for steady two-dimensional low-to-moderate-Reynolds number flows of incompressible fluids, using primitive variables, is presented. The velocity gradients in the Navier–Stokes equations are evaluated using the alternatives of upwind and central finite difference approximations, and derivatives of finite element shape functions. A direct iterative scheme is used to cope with the non-linear character of the integral equations. In order to achieve convergence, an underrelaxation technique is employed at relatively high Reynolds numbers. Driven cavity flow in a square domain is considered to validate the proposed method by comparison with other published data. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Slip flow in a rectangular cavity is studied. Using slip eigenfunctions, an exact series solution is found for a lid sliding longitudinally. For a transversely sliding lid, the stream function for Stokes flow is determined by a new set of slip eigenfunctions and supplemented by point match on the boundary. It is found that slip has considerable effect on the flow properties. Analyses of the region very close to the corner of the velocity discontinuity show the stress singularity of no-slip flow can be eliminated by slip for both longitudinal flow and transverse flow, except when the latter corner is a right angle.}

abstract = {This paper brings a numerical analysis of the TRT modeling for the Lattice-Boltzmann method when solving flow for dilatant and pseudoplastic power-law fluids. Firstly, the method was reviewed to describe the required simulation parameters and the numerical methodology. Secondly, a mathematical procedure was performed to identify the characteristic relaxation frequency as a function of both flow and fluid properties and to work as a guide parameter for LBM operation. Then, a simple shearing Poiseuille flow was employed so its characteristic shear rate could be calculated as a function of fluid properties, given the flow was characterized by the Reynolds and Mach numbers. For this test case, convergence was then explored for a broad range of parameters, and its non-monotonic dependency on the Mach number for a given convergence criterion was shown. Then, stability maps were constructed based on the characteristic relaxation frequency, which showed a strong dependency between consistency and flow index so the simulation could converge. This was explored against the results from the converged tests, which pointed out the usefulness of the characteristic relaxation frequency in predicting stable solutions. Finally, quantitatively, it was shown that for this power-law fluid flow, the ||L2|| relative error depends on the Mach number to the power of 2(2−n) being now a function of the flow index, extending the previously reported dependency of the Mach number to the power of 2 for plane-Poiseuille flow.}

    abstract = { Sufficient conditions are established for the convergence of the biorthogonal series solving edge problems which arise in elasticity and in Stokes flow in cavities. These conditions and those given in Part I, (D. D. Joseph, The convergence of biorthogonal series for biharmonic and Stokes flow edge problems, SIAM, J. Appl. Math., 33(1977), pp. 337–347) include all those which are likely to arise in applications. Examples of conditional convergence of the series to step functions and to ramp functions are presented. Problems previously considered to be intractable to analysis are solved by analysis. }
